    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>Growing up I had always wanted to be in the military, my father and grandfather were both in it for quite some time so it always seemed amazing to me. I cannot exactly say how or why it happened but at a younger age I began to become a lot more introverted, the military no longer seemed like a valid path for me. At the same time video games took over my life, I loved them and imagined creating them. I want to learn to create games, I know this is a long process but it is essentially my life goal. I feel that although this path may be filled with lots of hardships, it will also bring me plenty of opportunities. 

      I do not have any notable experience in developing/designing games but I have plenty of experience in playing games. It may not be as technical as what makes a game work but I know how a game should feel. How to make a game feel good to the player, make it make sense to everyone. The majority of what I spend my time on currently is playing games, perhaps going too far in doing so. Currently what I spend my time on is MOBA (Mobile Online Battle Arenas). The games themselves are not the most complicated, but what is truly important about them is the balancing of characters and items. The more characters and items are added the more complex the game becomes, even if I cannot directly change the game I have plenty of ideas for balancing. 
      
      What I have learned about myself from life is that I am not the most driven person. However that only goes for things I have no interest in, for the things I love however I am plenty driven. Just recently I spent around 8-10 hours learning the basics of 4 different modeling/3d animation softwares just for a quick project. While it did not dive deep it showed me that I am willing to put work into the things I have interest in.
